# About the Project

**Quick Note & Sketch Board** is a web application that allows users to quickly jot down notes and create sketches in one convenient place. Each note or sketch can be saved along with your current location, making it easy to remember where your ideas originated.

**Key Features:**
- **Note Taking:** Write and save text notes easily.
- **Sketching:** Draw diagrams or doodles directly in the app.
- **Location Tagging:** Automatically saves your current location with each note/sketch (if you allow location access).
- **Offline Support:** All notes and sketches are stored in your browser, so you can access them even without an internet connection.
- **Simple Management:** View, revisit, or delete your saved notes and sketches at any time.

This project is designed for anyone who wants a fast, private, and distraction-free way to capture ideas and visuals together, wherever inspiration strikes.
