# About the Project

**Smart Travel Assistant** is a web application that helps users find attractions, monitor their network status, and get location-based information for smarter travel.

**Key Features:**
- **Location Info:** Displays your current location using the Geolocation API.
- **Network Status:** Shows your network connection type, speed, and status using the Network Information API.
- **Nearby Attractions:** Lazy-loads images of attractions as you scroll, using the Intersection Observer API.
- **Offline Support:** Works even when you are offline (data is stored in your browser).

This project is designed for anyone who wants a fast, private, and distraction-free way to get travel information and recommendations, wherever they are.
